/*
     A "Grade Calculator" form that takes as input a percentage scored for each grade
        category listed in the syllabus


        Build a JavaScript program that calculates and displays both a final percentage and a letter grade
        using the "Grade Calculator" form entries based on the weights listed in the syllabus. Use
        jQuery selectors (i.e. the “$”) in your program. Print the letter grade to the form (not in an alert.)


        Write good code (use good indentation, commenting, whitespace, descriptive variable names,
        etc.) Good style counts for 10% of the score on each assignment. -->
        <!-- Grade weights (approximate):
            Assignments 50 %
            Group Project 10 %
            Quizzes 10 %
            Midterm Exam 10 %
            Final Exam 10 %
            INTEX 10 %
